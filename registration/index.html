    <h2>Motivation:</h2>
    <p>
      The "Workshop on Vision-Based Understanding for Low-Resource Languages"
      addresses the challenges of applying computer vision and AI to languages
      with limited resources. The primary goal is to promote the integration of
      computer vision in linguistic diversity and stimulate interest within the
      computer vision and AI community regarding novel problems specific to
      low-resource languages. Since low-resource language research and solutions
      are less commercially attractive, there is a lag of serious efforts in
      this space - a gap we plan to address in this workshop. By bridging the
      digital divide, this workshop aims to empower individuals from diverse
      linguistic backgrounds and foster collaboration in this crucial area of
      research. We are encouraging researchers and engineers to submit ongoing
      research, ideas, demos, and applications to advance computer vision
      technologies for low-resource languages and create a platform for a
      vibrant community to collectively drive innovation for inclusivity and
      technological progress on a global scale. The initiative will emphasize
      ensuring equitable benefits for speakers of all languages, ultimately
      enriching lives across linguistic communities and creating a more
      inclusive future.
    </p>

    <h2>Impact:</h2>
    <p>
      The workshop aspires to have a significant impact by serving as a platform
      for disseminating and exchanging ideas, concepts, and results of
      researchers from academia and industry. This will facilitate a
      comprehensive understanding of the challenges in advancing low-resource
      language-based vision applications. Strengthening congenial and effective
      networking between academia and industry will promote collaborative
      efforts in addressing the unique challenges faced by low-resource
      languages. By adhering to a stringent and careful double-blind peer-review
      process, the workshop aims to enrich the quality of contributions and
      ensure rigorous scientific evaluation. The focus on reaching novel
      contributions in the areas of low-resource languages and computer vision
      will lead to valuable reference material for advanced research with global
      impact, benefiting more than 6,500 languages worldwide.
    </p>

    <h2>Expected Outcomes:</h2>
    <p>
      The workshop envisions several expected outcomes, including the
      dissemination of valuable ideas, concepts, and research results related to
      low-resource language-based vision applications. This will contribute to a
      deeper understanding of the challenges and pave the way for more
      innovative solutions. Strengthening networking between academia and
      industry can lead to fruitful collaborations and partnerships,
      accelerating the translation of research into real-world applications. The
      stringent peer-review process will ensure the acceptance of high-quality
      research, driving the field's scientific rigor and credibility. The
      workshop's focus on novel contributions in low-resource languages and
      computer vision will serve as a catalyst for future research and
      development, empowering linguistic diversity with technology. Ultimately,
      the workshop seeks to create a more inclusive future, where computer
      vision technologies benefit speakers of all languages, regardless of their
      economic status or geographic location. Through meaningful dialogue and
      collaboration, the workshop aims to yield impactful solutions, positively
      enriching lives across linguistic communities and contributing to a more
      equitable technological landscape.
