    <h2>Social impact of the workshop:</h2>
    <p>
      The WVLL is poised to create a significant social impact by addressing
      challenges in applying computer vision to languages with limited
      resources. The workshop's focus on promoting inclusivity and empowering
      linguistic diversity can bridge the digital divide, ensuring equitable
      access to technology advancements for speakers of all languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through advancements in document image processing, optical character
      recognition, and scene text recognition tailored to low-resource
      languages, the workshop can improve access to information and preserve
      cultural heritage. Digitizing historical texts, medical records, and
      cultural artifacts can facilitate knowledge dissemination and enrich
      educational resources in these linguistic communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, vision-based technologies can have a direct impact on
      healthcare, enhancing medical diagnosis and access to healthcare
      information. By fostering international collaboration, the workshop can
      lead to shared resources, best practices, and solutions for addressing the
      unique challenges faced by low-resource languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The workshop's outcomes can inspire future research and innovation,
      motivating researchers and students to actively engage in this critical
      area. By raising awareness about the social impact of a vision-based
      understanding of low-resource languages, the workshop can drive policy
      discussions and contribute to broader sustainable development goals. By
      leveraging computer vision technologies to address the needs of
      underrepresented languages, the workshop can create a more inclusive and
      equitable future, ensuring that advancements in technology benefit
      speakers of all languages worldwide.
